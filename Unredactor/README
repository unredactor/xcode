README

This app was created by Tyler Gee as an open source project as Manceps' Unredactor iOS port. If you are contributing to this project, add your name.
This app tries it's best to follow Apple's MVC code structure.

This is the current structure of a view controller file for organizational and navigational purposes (aka where do I put this function)


// MARK: - Delegate
protocol ViewControllerDelegate {

}

// MARK: - Class Definition
/*
[Description of what the class does]
*/
class ViewController: Superclass {
    // MARK: - Properties
    - IBOutlets
    - Public properties
        * Variables
        * Constants
        * Delegate(s) (if applicable)
    - Private properties
        * Variables
        * Constants

    // MARK: - View Life Cycle Functions
    Put these in order of them happening (viewDidLoad, viewWillAppear, viewWillDisappear, maybe deinit)

    // MARK: Functions
    - Put public functions here that are intended as the interface

    // MARK: - Navigation
    - functions dealing with navigation and the storyboard (basically just prepare(for:))
}

// MARK: - Helper functions
extension ViewController {
    - Private functions that are used solely by the class
}

// MARK: - Extensions

// MARK: - [protocol name]
extension ViewController: ProtocolDelegate {
    - implementation of protocol
    - (maybe?) helper functions used only in this extension
}

... [more extensions]

// end - try to keep these under a few hundred lines, if they get larger than 300-400 you should split it up somehow, aim for under 200

This whole thing is made up, if you have a suggestion or reason to change it, then do
